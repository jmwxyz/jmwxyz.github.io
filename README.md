     Hi, I am Jiaming Wen (文嘉明), a last-year undergraduate student in Mathematical Base Class, School of Mathematics and Statistics(MATHS), Wuhan University. This autumn, I will become a first-year academic master student in School of Cyber Science and Engineering(CSE), Wuhan University.

  My general interests cover Machine Learning，Mathematics and Cryptography,. I will share some notes from books or websites  on this page, and in most cases, I will give the orginal. The reason why I do it is that it's convenient for me to review.
