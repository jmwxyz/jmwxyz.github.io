     Hi, I am Jiaming Wen (文嘉明), a last-year undergraduate student in Mathematical Base Class, School of Mathematics and Statistics(MATHS), Wuhan University. Next autumn, I will become a first-year academic master student in School of Cyber Science and Engineering(CSE), Wuhan University.

  My general interests cover algebra, number theory and cryptography. I will share some notes from books I read and my publications on this homepage in the future.
